    <body>
        <p>My name is Daniel Miller and I was born and raised in Tennessee, specifically collegedale.
            My major is computer science and some hobbys that I 
            enjoy doing are 3d printing, mountain biking, and music.
            I apologize for taking so long to start submitting my work, I Unfortantly 
            caught covid the first week of class. I am well now and will be catching up fast.
